- 👋 Hi, I’m @Wirexia-git
- 👀 I’m interested in everything? I am not sure about this one yet. Perhaps, game development and software engineering look very interesting for me.
- 🌱 I’m currently doing my BS in Computer Science, just finished first year. Most interested in C, Python and Java.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on project, where a first year student could be useful. I want to improve my skills in the field as much as I can.
- 📫 How to reach me: wirexia66@gmail.com - if you prefer email - or Wirexia#2808 on Discord
